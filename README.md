# Gym-Progress-Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes and visualizes my gym progress over time. The notebook documents my workout routines, focusing on five major lifts: deadlift, squat, bench press, military press, and pull-ups. It employs the Epley Formula to estimate 1RM (one repetition maximum) for each lift and presents the data through a series of plots, showcasing the evolution of my performance. Additionally, the analysis includes workout durations and gym attendance visualization using a calendar heatmap. This project is a personal exploration of my fitness journey and serves as an example of data analysis and visualization in the context of personal health and fitness.
